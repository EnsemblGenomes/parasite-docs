  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>As international efforts to sequence helminth genomes and transcriptomes gather pace, a systematic approach to the integration and presentation of this data is needed to provide maximum utility for biomedical and agricultural research.  To this end, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute have collaborated on the provision of a new online resource, WormBase ParaSite.  This sub-portal of the main <a href="http://www.wormbase.org">WormBase</a> website is aimed at researchers engaged in parasitic worm genomics.  WormBase ParaSite encompasses flatworms as well as nematodes, and provides genome sequence, genome browsers, semi-automatic annotation and comparative genomics data for approximately one hundred species.  Additional tools include a cross species data mining platform, protein and nucleotide sequence search, and a variant effect predictor to enable the analysis of different strain/isolate genomes in the context of the reference.</p>

  <h1>Funding</h1>

  <p>WormBase ParaSite is funded by the <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk">UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</a> under grant numbers BB/K020080/1 and BB/K020048/1.</p>
 
  <h1>Technical</h1>

  <p>The website is powered by the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a> genome browser framework, which has been adapted to suit the needs of the parasitology community.</p>
