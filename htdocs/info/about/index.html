  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>As international efforts to sequence helminth genomes and transcriptomes gather pace, a systematic approach to the integration and presentation of this data is needed to provide maximum utility for biomedical and agricultural research.  To this end, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home">EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute</a>and the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/">University of Glasgow</a> have collaborated on the provision of a new online resource, WormBase ParaSite.  This sister resource of the main <a href="http://www.wormbase.org">WormBase</a> website is aimed at researchers engaged in parasitic worm genomics.  WormBase ParaSite encompasses flatworms as well as nematodes, and provides genome sequence, genome browsers, semi-automatic annotation and comparative genomics data for approximately one hundred species.  Additional tools include a cross species data mining platform, protein and nucleotide sequence search, a variant effect predictor to enable the analysis of different strain/isolate genomes in the context of the reference and a collaborative tool for performing gene enrichment analysis.</p>

  <h1>Funding</h1>

  <p>WormBase ParaSite is currently funded by the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">UK Medical Research Council</a> under grant number MR/S000453/1.</p>
 
  <h1>Technical</h1>

  <p>The website is powered by the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl</a> genome browser framework, which has been adapted to suit the needs of the parasitology community.</p>
    
  <h1>Recognition</h1>
  
  <p>WormBase ParaSite has been recognised by the <a href="https://globalbiodata.org/">Global Biodata Coalition</a> as a <a href="https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources/">Global Core Biodata Resource</a> whose long term funding and sustainability is critical to life science and biomedical research worldwide.</p>
