  <h1>Data Usage</h1>
  
  <p>Authors using unpublished genomic and other data from WormBase ParaSite are expected to abide by the guidelines of the <a href="/info/about/ext/fortlauderdale.pdf">Fort Lauderdale</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/full/461168a.html">Toronto</a> agreements.  Based on broadly accepted scientific community standards, the key requirement for the third parties using genomic and other data is to contact the owners of unpublished data (i.e. the principal investigator and sequencing centre) prior to undertaking their research, to advise them about their planned analyses.</p>
