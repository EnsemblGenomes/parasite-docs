  <h1>Data Usage and Citations</h1>
  
  <h2>Unpublished Genomes</h2>
  <p>Authors using unpublished genomic and other data from WormBase ParaSite are expected to abide by the guidelines of the <a href="/info/about/ext/fortlauderdale.pdf">Fort Lauderdale</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/full/461168a.html">Toronto</a> agreements.  Based on broadly accepted scientific community standards, the key requirement for the third parties using genomic and other data is to contact the owners of unpublished data (i.e. the principal investigator and sequencing centre) prior to undertaking their research, to advise them about their planned analyses.</p>

  <h2>Published Genomes</h2>
  <p>Please cite the original paper for the genome publication.  A link to this paper will be available on the relevant species information page.  Additionally, please remember to cite WormBase ParaSite (see below) if you have used the website or any of the provided tools/downloads.</p>

  <h2>Citing WormBase ParaSite</h2>
  <p>Additionally, you are asked to cite WormBase ParaSite if you have used any part of the website or the provided tools/downloads in your research:</p>
