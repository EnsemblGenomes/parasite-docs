<h2>RNASeq tracks</h2>

<p>For some species, where data is available, WormBase ParaSite displays publicly available transcriptomic data as tracks aligned to the genome. These can be seen in the <a href="location_view.html">Location view</a>.</p>

<p>Hovering over the short track name to the left of the track brings up a window providing additional metadata about the track, and options to configure the track.</p>

<p>Metadata included under the 'i' icon tab are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ENA sample id</li>
  <li>ENA project id</li>
  <li>Array Express id (where available)</li>
  <li>Project description</li>
  <li>Literature reference (where available)</li>
</ul>

<p>The other tabs in this window allow you to alter the configuration of the track, turn it on and off and add it to your favourite tracks.</p>

<p>Tracks can also be configured by clicking on the <strong>'Configure this page'</strong> link in the left menu.</p>
