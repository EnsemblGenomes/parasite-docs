<h2>Species pages</h2>

<p>Each species in WormBase ParaSite has a summary page:</p>

[insert image]

<p>These pages give information about the species, the source of the genome assembly including any publications and the source of the genome annotation. Following the <strong>'More information and statistics'</strong> link takes you to a page giving more detailed information about the assembly and annotations including genome size and gene and transcript numbers.</p>

<p>The page provides links to example pages for the assembly, such as gene and transcript pages, and also links to the BioProject in the ENA and to a taxonomy database.</p>

<p>The species pages also links to various downloads for the assembly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.genomic.fa.gz             - Unmasked genomic DNA FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.genomic_masked.fa.gz      - Hard-masked (repeats replaced with Ns) genomic DNA FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.genomic_softmasked.fa.gz  - Soft-masked (repeats lower-cased) genomic DNA FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.proteins.fa.gz            - Current live protein set FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.CDS_transcripts.fa.gz     - Spliced cDNA sequence for the CDS portion of protein-coding transcripts FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.mRNA_transcripts.fa.gz    - Spliced cDNA sequence for the full-length (with UTRs) protein-coding transcripts FASTA format</li>
  <li>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.annotations.gff3.gz       - Sequence features in GFF3 format</li>
</ul>

<p>The species page gives you the option of searching just within the selected species by using the search box at the top of the page.</p>
