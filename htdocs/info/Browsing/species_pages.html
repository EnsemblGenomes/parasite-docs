<h2>Species pages</h2>

<p>Each species in WormBase ParaSite has a summary page:</p>

<p><img src="/img/species_page.png" alt="Species page" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>These pages give information about the species, the source of the genome assembly including any publications and the source of the genome annotation.</p>

<p>Following the <strong>'More information and statistics'</strong> link takes you to a page giving more detailed information about the assembly and annotations including genome size and gene and transcript numbers.</p>

<p>The  links to example pages for the assembly, such as gene and transcript pages, and also links to the BioProject in the ENA and to a taxonomy database.</p>

<p>Following the <img src="/img/downloads.png" alt="Downloads" style="width:300px;">link takes you to the various files you can download for the assembly. These are:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.genomic.fa.gz</td>
    <td>Unmasked genomic DNA FASTA format</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr><td>GENUS_SPECIES.BIOPROJECT.WBPS3.annotations.gff3.gz
      <td>Sequence features in GFF3 format</tr>
