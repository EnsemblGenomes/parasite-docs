<p>
  WormBase ParaSite allows you to add and visualise your own data within its browser. Once attached, the data remains visible at all times </p>

<h2 id="addtrack">How to add custom tracks</h2>

<p>
  You can add a track from any species-specific page, such as <a href="/Brugia_pahangi_prjeb497/Location/View?db=core;g=BPAG_0000844301;r=BPAG_scaffold0000006:300136-302227;t=BPAG_0000844301-mRNA-1"><strong>Region in Detail</strong></a>.
</p> 
<p> 
To attach a custom track, click the <strong>Add your data</strong> button at the left of most ParaSite views (which reads <strong>Manage your data</strong> if you already have added custom data).
</p>
<p>
Choose a species from the menu (by default the species for the current page is selected) and then select a data format (see more about supported file types below). Enter the URL where your data can be found (or upload your data, see below) and hit <strong>Attach</strong>.</p>
<p>
  Set the colour option and <strong>Save</strong>. You should get a message to say your data has been succsessfully attached. Close the wondow and your track will automatically display in the view in which you have added it.

<h3>Ways to add tracks to WormBase ParaSite</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Attach the URL at which your data can be accessed. The file will be read each time you visit a page that has the track on. Supported file types are listed below.
  </li>
  
  <li>For non-indexed file types, such as VCF and GFF, you also have the option of uploading a file to our servers (max 20MB unzipped), from either your own computer or a location on the web. If uploaded from a URL, you can use the 'Reload' function in the 'Manage Your Data' table to refresh the file from the same location.
  </li>
  
  <li>Attach a DAS (Distributed Annotation System) source, either from your own DAS server or anywhere else on the internet.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="access">Data access and security</h2>

<h3>Saving and sharing tracks</h3>

<p>Uploaded data is saved temporarily to our filesystem and accessed
via cookie, so you can only view it from the browser in which you 
uploaded it (unless you click the share icon as below). For longer-term access to your data, you can save the 
track to our database server, but this requires a user account.
Once logged in, you will see a 'Save' link next to your track - click
on this and the track will be transferred to the database and can be
accessed on any computer where you are logged in to WormBase ParaSite.</p>

<p>Remote data is not saved to the database. Only the URL or source
name is saved to your user account, to allow you to access the file
easily from any location, without having to reattach it.</p>

<p>If you display your data on a Location view such as Region in Detail, click the sharing icon, or the <strong>Share this page</strong> button at the left, to send the same view, including your own track, to someone else.</p>

<h3 id="DeletingTracks">Deleting tracks</h3>

<p> 
The track will remain on your display while you navigate around the
genome. To hide the track, choose the "no display" option (empty box)
for that track in the <strong>Configure this page</strong> menu.</p>

<p>To remove the data set, click the <strong>Manage your data</strong> 
link at the left of Location. Click <strong>Manage data</strong> at the left of the
window. The tracks you have currently uploaded and/or attached will
be listed. Click delete next to any you wish to remove.
</p>

<h3 id="Disclaimer">Data Upload Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
Although your data source is allocated a unique ID and any management
operations on saved data (<i>e. g.</i> deleting) require a
password, <strong>this is only trivial security</strong>. Data
uploads are made on an <strong>open, non-secure</strong> network
connection. If your data is sensitive you should not upload it but
contact us for more information.
