<h2>Transcript pages</h2>

<p>The transcript page is the source of information relating to an RNA transcript of a gene. All transcript pages have a header section which summarizes the key information about the transcript:</p>

<p><img src="/img/transcript_page_1.png" alt="Transcript page" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>This includes (top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transcript id</li>
  <li>Short description (where available)</li>
  <li>Location of the transcript within the genome</li>
  <li>Additional information about the transcript including number of exons and domains and features</li>
  <li>Table of all transcripts for the source gene</li>
</ul>

<p>The menu on the left-hand side allows you navigate through available data:</p>

<p><img src="/img/transcript_page_2.png" alt="Transcript page" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>Available data are:</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>This is a summary view of the transcript</p>

  <h3>Splice variants</h3>
  <p>Displays all known splice variants as a table and in a browser view.</p>

  <h3>Sequence</h3>
  <p>This displays the nucleotide sequence of the gene. Exons are highlighted in pink/red:</p>

  <p>This page also gives you the option of downloading the sequence in FASTA or RTF formats, or to BLAST the sequence using the WormBase ParaSite <a href="Tools/blast.html">BLAST service</a>.</p>

  <h3>External references</h3>
  <p>Links to external databases such as EntrezGene and WormBase.</p>

  <h3>Protein Information</h3>
  <p>Displays information about the protein product of the transcript.
    
  <h4>Protein Summary</h4>
  <p>Displays a summary image of the protein domains and their location within the full-length protein.</p>

  <h4>Domains and Features</h4>
  <p>Displays all protein domains and features for the protein as a table, with links to the originating resource e.g. Panther or Pfam.</p>
  
  <h4>AlphaFold predicted model</h4>
  <p>The structure from AlphaFold DB for the selected transcript is viewable through the AlphaFold browser widget. For transcripts where a model is available, it is possible to highlight individual residues, variants, exon boundaries, and protein features on the predicted structure. This includes the ability to focus on one feature at a time, for example highlighting a single exon. By default, the structure is colour coded based on a pLDDT score, to show the confidence of the predictions.</p>
