<h2>Transcript pages</h2>

<p>The transcript page is the source of information relating to an RNA transcript of a gene. All transcript pages have a header section which summarizes the key information about the transcript:</p>

<p><img src="/img/transcript_page_1.png" alt="Transcript page" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>This includes (top to bottom):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transcript id</li>
  <li>Short description (where available)</li>
  <li>Location of the transcript within the genome</li>
  <li>Additional information about the transcript including number of exons and domains and features</li>
  <li>Table of all transcripts for the source gene</li>
</ul>

<p>The menu on the left-hand side allows you navigate through available data:</p>

<p><img src="/img/transcript_page_2.png" alt="Transcript page" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>Available data are:</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>This is a summary view of the transcript</p>

  <h3>Splice variants</h3>
  <p>Displays all known splice variants as a table and in a browser view.</p>

  <h3>Sequence</h3>
  <p>This displays the nucleotide sequence of the gene. Exons are highlighted in pink/red:</p>

  <p>This page also gives you the option of downloading the sequence in FASTA or RTF formats, or to BLAST the sequence using the WormBase ParaSite <a href="Tools/blast.html">BLAST service</a>.</p>

  <h3>External references</h3>
  <p>Links to external databases such as EntrezGene and WormBase.</p>

  <h3>Ontology</h3>
  <p>Displays all available Gene Ontology annotation data from the three ontologies: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. Clicking on the 'Chart' icon for a particular term displays a tree view of for that GO term up to the root node, and selecting the Ancestry chart tab shows a tree view for all annotated terms in the selected ontology.</p>

  <h3>Comparative Genomics</h3>
      
      <h4>Gene tree</h4>
      
      <h4>Orthologues</h4>
      <p>Displays a list of all orthologous genes (i.e. evolved from a common ancestral gene) in species in WormBase ParaSite as well as some other comparitor and model species including Caenorhabiditis elegans, human, Drosophila melanogaster,  Mouse and Zebrafish. The list can be filtered using the summary table at the top - by default all orthologs are displayed.</p>
      
      <p>The alignment data underlying the table can be downloaded in a variety of different formats including FASTA, CLUSTAL W, Mega, MSF, Nexus, OrthoXML, Pfam, Phylip, PSI and Stockholm by following the link at the top of the table.</p>
      
      <h4>Paralogues</h4>
      
      <p>Displays a list of all paralogous genes (i.e. homologous gene sequences created by a duplication events within a genome).</p> 
      
        <p>The alignment data underlying the table can be downloaded in a variety of different formats including FASTA, CLUSTAL W, Mega, MSF, Nexus, OrthoXML, Pfam, Phylip, PSI and Stockholm by following the link at the top of the table.</p>
        
    </ul>
