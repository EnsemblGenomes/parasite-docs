<h2>Location view</h2>

<p>This is an interactive view of the genome, centered on the selected gene.</p>

<p><img src="/img/region_in_detail.png" alt="Location view" class="image-expand" style="height:400px;"></p>

<h3>Whole scaffold/contig view</h3>
<p>The top image shows the full scaffold or contig, with the location being displayed in detail highlighted by a red box. The selected area can be changed by clicking on the scaffold. This brings up a menu that allows the selected area to be re-centered or to zoom in or out. Alternatively you can select and drag to choose a new area of the scaffold or contig.</p>

<h3>Region in detail</h3>
<p>The second panel shows a zoomed-in view centered on the selected gene. The control panel underneath allows you to jump to a particular location or gene by entering them in each of the boxes on the left and clicking 'GO'. On the right there is a control which allows you to scroll along the scaffold or contig by clicking the left or right arrows. The single arrow scrolls you along by a window width and the double arrow scrolls along 1MB. Alternatively, you can scroll by clicking and dragging the region in detail image. You can also zoom in and out of the view using the + and - , or by dragging the slider to the desired location.</p>

<h3>Static region in detail view</h3>
<p>The bottom panel is a static, further zoomed in image of the area selected in the region in detail view. Any available data tracks - for example <a href="RNASeq_tracks.html">RNASeq alignments</a> - are also displayed here.</p>
