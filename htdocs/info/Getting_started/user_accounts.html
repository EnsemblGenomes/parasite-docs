<h1>User accounts</h1>

<p>WormBase ParaSite gives you the option of creating a user account. This allows you to save your configuration between sessions and between machines, as well as being able to keep your own sets of data tracks permanently attached. It also allows you to privately share attached data tracks with other WormBase ParaSite users.</p>

<p>To create an account, click the link at the right of the page header:</p>

<p><img src="/img/login_1.png" alt="Logging in" class="image-expand" style="width:400px;"></p>

<p>Fill in your name, email address, organisation and country and click <strong>Register</strong>. A verification email will be sent to the account you entered. Follow the link in the email to verify your account and to set your password which should be at least 6 characters.</p>

<p>You should now be logged in to your account, and instead of a <strong>Register</strong> link in the header you will see <strong>My account -</strong> followed by your account email address. To login in future sessions, use the <strong>Login</strong> link in the header.</p>



<p>Note that the main <a href="http://www.wormbase.org/">WormBase site</a> requires a separate user account to WormBase ParaSite.</p>
