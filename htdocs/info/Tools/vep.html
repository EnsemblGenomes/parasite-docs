<p>
The VEP determines the effect of your variants (SNPs, insertions,
deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, and
protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions through a simple point-and-click interface. Simply input the
coordinates of your variants and the nucleotide changes to find out the:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>genes</b> and <b>transcripts</b> affected by the variants</li>
<li><b>location</b> of the variants (e.g. upstream of a transcript, in coding sequence, in non-coding RNA, in regulatory regions)</li>
<li><b>consequence</b> of your variants on the protein sequence (e.g. stop gained, missense, stop lost, frameshift)</li>
<li><b>known variants</b> that match yours</li>
<li><b>SIFT</b> and <b>PolyPhen</b> scores for changes to protein sequence</li>
</ul>
