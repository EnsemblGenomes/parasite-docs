<h1>BioMart</h1>

<p>WormBase ParaSite BioMart is a simple, web-based tool for mining data from the WormBase ParaSite database.</p>

<p>There are two main aspects to using BioMart, which can be navigated to in the menu on the left of the tool:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Filters</strong> which defines the data you would like to include as input for your query</li>
  <li><strong>Attributes</strong> which defines the data types you want as output</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><h3 id="toc1">1) Setting your filters</h3></p>

<p>Filters are shown as a list in which each of the items can be expanded:</p>

[insert img of filters]

The following filters are available:

<ul>
  <li><strong>SPECIES:</strong> Use this filter to select either individual genomes or particular nematode clades. Multiple genomes can be selected by holding down ctrl or the option key on a Mac.</li>
  <li><strong>REGION:</strong> Restrict to a particular genomic region. Note that this filter should only be used where a single genome has been selected, as it is possibile that a particular region is present in multiple genomes.
  <p>If start/end co-ordinates are being specified, a scaffold or chromosome id is also required.</p>
  <p>Where multiple regions are specified, the format is Scaffold/Chr:Start:End:Strand e.g. <a href="http://goo.gl/uusiH6">AG00032:411187:446321:1</a>. If no strand is specified, both strands are selected. Regions should be separated by a comma or new line.</p></li>
