  <h1>WormBase ParaSite Workshops</h1>
  
  <p>
    To help our users make the most of this valuable resource, we are visiting universities and institutes to provide hands-on training sessions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These workshops will consist of a whole or part day of talks and hands-on practical exercises, centred on this new free resource for helminth genomics.  During the session, there will be plenty of time to discuss the application to your own research, face-to-face with the developers of this database.
