  <h1>WormBase ParaSite Workshops</h1>
  
  <p>
    To help our users make the most of this valuable resource, we are visiting universities and institutes to provide hands-on training sessions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These workshops will consist of a whole or part day of talks and hands-on practical exercises, centred on this new free resource for helminth genomics.  During the session, there will be plenty of time to discuss the application to your own research, face-to-face with the developers of this database.

      <p>
        A typical workshop will consist of the following sessions:
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to WormBase ParaSite: origin, goals and organisation of the project</li>
          <li>Browsing the website: how to search, find information about genes and use the genome browser</li>
          <li>Comparative genomics: finding orthologues and paralogues</li>
          <li>BLAST: searching using sequence</li>
          <li>Data export with BioMart: advanced search using a web interface, working with lists of data and retrieving sequence in bulk</li>
          <li>Variant Effect Predictor: determining the consequences of variations on genes and transcripts</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Workshops are aimed at <b>wet-lab researchers</b> with general knowledge of molecular biology and genomics.  No previous experience of using WormBase is required.  Attending a workshop is free of charge.
